## Description
This was a hw assignment for my Coding Bootcamp through Rutgers. We were tasked with creating a CLI utility for prompting a user information about the employees they'd like to create in a team generator. The answers would then get fed into a constructor class to create the type of employees chosen. Finally when the user is through with the application, we would render a basic html site with all of the users created.
